 * The Player class tracks the actual players in the MancalaGame. The Player will have a name and the MancalaGame they are
 * associated with, thus preserving the many players to one MancalaGame but one MancalaGame to many players relationship.
 * To be competed later:
 * There needs to be logic added to connect a player and their store and their side of the board. This is unnecessary for
 * the completion of this assignment but something to think about when we need to determine a winner of the game.
