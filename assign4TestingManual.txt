To start the tests for the individual projects, simply open one of the files in
the src/test/java directories. Once you do that, the whole project should appear
on IntelliJ. From there, you can either right click the test/java folder or the
test file itself and click "Run All Tests" or "Run [filename]". All of our tests
for each project are in one file in their corresponding project.
